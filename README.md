### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a part time freelance full stack software engineer from Pasadena, CA
I am also the Director of Software Engineering at a local REIT

I am not very active in the open source community, as most of my work is confidential. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on porting legacy .Net framework line of business applications to .Net 5 (soon 6) + Blazor
- ðŸ”­ I'm also working on a soon to be open sourced "Dice Roller" tool for distributed gaming groups.  The pandemic has pushed us all further apart physically, we want to enable people to continue interacting virtually.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning best practices for Blazor
